// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Start

A = 20
B = 10

sum = 30

a + b = 30



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if input % 2:
print even


else:
Print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A = 5
B = 7
C = 9
D = 3
E = 11

Add all inputs then % 5


Answer == Average

If input is < 7 = minimum

Or

If input is > 9 = maximum


Average == 7

Minimum == 5

Maximum == 11
